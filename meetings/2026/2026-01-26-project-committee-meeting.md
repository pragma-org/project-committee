- **Quality Assurance:** Highlighted the need to avoid low-quality projects to protect PRAGMA’s reputation.
- **Project Health and Stability:** Discussed the importance of **project maturity, health, and stability**, using metrics like **ossinsight.io** as indicators, but acknowledged that quality is not solely quantifiable.
- **Formal Specifications:** Agreed to address formal specifications if needed, leveraging expertise from PRAGMA’s broader organization (e.g., Amaru team).
